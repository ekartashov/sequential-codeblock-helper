### Sequential State Management Pattern
The core pattern in this project is handling sequential state management across disconnected code blocks. This pattern can be applied to other systems where:
- Execution happens in discrete steps
- State needs to be tracked across steps
- Each step may need to be executable in isolation

Key components:
1. **State identification** - Detecting variables and their definitions
2. **Dependency tracking** - Finding relationships between variables across blocks
3. **State reconstruction** - Building the minimum necessary state for any given block

### Document-as-Code Pattern
This project demonstrates a pattern for working with documentation that contains executable code segments. This pattern is useful for:
- Technical documentation with examples
- Tutorials that guide users through multi-step processes
- Educational materials that combine explanations and executable code

The pattern involves:
1. **Markup separation** - Using special markers to distinguish code blocks with special properties
2. **Section structuring** - Organizing code into well-defined sections (Variables, Script, etc.)
3. **Cross-referencing** - Enabling references between different parts of the documentation

### Variable Reference Resolution Pattern
The technique used for identifying and resolving variable references could be applied to other systems that need to:
- Parse and understand script variables
- Identify implicit dependencies between code segments
- Generate self-contained code snippets from larger codebases

This pattern combines regex-based detection with dependency graph construction to ensure all required variables are included.
