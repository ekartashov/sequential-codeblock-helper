[2025-05-08 18:43:08] - ## Current Project State

The Sequential Codeblock Helper project is currently in a functional state with all core components implemented:

1. **example.md** - Contains comprehensive examples of sequential code blocks with various edge cases
2. **sequential_codeblock_helper.py** - Implements the main functionality for processing markdown files
3. **README.md** - Provides complete documentation for the project

### Working Features
- Parsing markdown files to extract sequential code blocks
- Analyzing variable definitions and dependencies
- Generating output with preset variables sections
- Support for different shell types (bash, sh, zsh, etc.)
- Basic CLI interface with options for output format and color

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Testing** - Add unit tests to validate functionality across different edge cases
2. **Format Support** - Fully implement HTML and Markdown output formats
3. **Performance Optimization** - Improve regex patterns for better parsing performance
4. **Recursive Dependencies** - Enhance the dependency resolution to better handle complex variable references
5. **Integration** - Create plugins for documentation systems like MkDocs or Sphinx

### Next Steps
1. Test the current implementation with various example files
2. Create a requirements.txt file (though currently only standard libraries are used)
3. Consider adding support for additional code block types beyond bash/shell
4. Gather feedback from early users to identify pain points or missing features
