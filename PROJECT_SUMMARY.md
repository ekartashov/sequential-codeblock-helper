# Sequential Codeblock Helper - Project Summary

## Implementation Status

We have successfully implemented the Sequential Codeblock Helper with:

1. **Enhanced example.md** - A comprehensive showcase of sequential codeblocks with various use cases:
   - Complex variable dependencies
   - Multiple shell types (bash, zsh, Python)
   - Dry-Run Script sections
   - Array variables and nested substitutions
   - Blocks in different markdown contexts

2. **Functional Python script** - `sequential_codeblock_helper.py` that:
   - Parses markdown files to extract sequential codeblocks
   - Analyzes variable definitions and dependencies
   - Generates output showing both original blocks and dependency-aware versions
   - Features a CLI interface with output formatting options

3. **Complete documentation** - README.md covering:
   - Project overview and purpose
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Implementation details

## Memory Bank Updates

All project knowledge has been captured in the memory bank:
- **progress.md** - Implementation progress and milestones
- **decisionLog.md** - Key design decisions and rationales
- **systemPatterns.md** - Identified design patterns that could be applied elsewhere
- **activeContext.md** - Current project state and potential enhancements

## Next Steps

To complete the project setup:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file (needs to be done in Code mode)
2. Test the implementation with the provided example file
3. Consider further enhancements as documented in the active context
4. Gather user feedback to guide future development

This project demonstrates effective handling of sequential state management across disconnected code blocks, which could be applied to other systems with similar requirements.
